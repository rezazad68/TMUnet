# [Contextual Attention Network: Transformer Meets U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01932)

Contexual attention network for medical image segmentation with state of the art results on skin lesion segmentation, multiple myeloma cell segmentation. This method incorpotrates the transformer module into a U-Net structure so as to concomitantly capture long-range dependency along with resplendent local informations.

## Updates
- February 27, 2022: First release (Complete implemenation for [SKin Lesion Segmentation on ISIC 2017](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2017/), [SKin Lesion Segmentation on ISIC 2018](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/), [SKin Lesion Segmentation on PH2](https://www.fc.up.pt/addi/ph2%20database.html) and [Multiple Myeloma Cell Segmentation (SegPC 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/sbilab/segpc2021dataset) dataset added.)

This code has been implemented in python language using Pytorch library and tested in ubuntu OS, though should be compatible with related environment. following Environement and Library needed to run the code:

- Python 3
- Pytorch


## Run Demo
For training deep model and evaluating on each data set follow the bellow steps:</br>
1- Download the ISIC 2018 train dataset from [this](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data) link and extract both training dataset and ground truth folders inside the `dataset_isic18`. </br>
2- Run `Prepare_ISIC2018.py` for data preperation and dividing data to train,validation and test sets. </br>
3- Run `train_skin.py` for training the model using trainng and validation sets. The model will be train for 100 epochs and it will save the best weights for the valiation set. </br>
4- For performance calculation and producing segmentation result, run `evaluate_skin.py`. It will represent performance measures and will saves related results in `output` folder.</br>

**Notice:**
For training and evaluating on ISIC 2017 and ph2 follow the bellow steps: :</br>
**ISIC 2017**- Download the ISIC 2017 train dataset from [this](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data) link and extract both training dataset and ground truth folders inside the `dataset_isic18\7`. </br> then Run ` 	Prepare_ISIC2017.py` for data preperation and dividing data to train,validation and test sets. </br>
**ph2**- Download the ph2 dataset from [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k88qukc20ljnbuo/PH2Dataset.rar) link and extract it then Run ` 	Prepare_ph2.py` for data preperation and dividing data to train,validation and test sets. </br>
Follow step 3 and 4 for model traing and performance estimation. For ph2 dataset you need to first train the model with ISIC 2017 data set and then fine-tune the trained model using ph2 dataset.
